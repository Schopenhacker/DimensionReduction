Dimension reduction
*******************
1. Random Projection:

we'll use the implementation of sparse random projection to show that the dimension reduction have serious impact on the performance of a Machine earning Classifier.
in the first example we have used a linear SVM classifier and we have used it On MNIST datadet.
the he have visualized the resulats and it has poven that the perfomance can be effectively enhanced by choosing the optimal dimensions to which the original data would be projected via sparse random projection

2. SVD:

we have applied singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of a white&black picture and than we'll display different reconstruction of the picture to figure out the optimal number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors to consider, so that the compressed picture would the most looks like
the original one
